# Tutorial

In this tutorial we configure the rest of our graphics pipeline create info to prepare our pipeline for drawing.

## Building

Follow the steps in tutorial 0 that go over how to set up your development environment. Next create a directory for your project and copy the contents of this tutorial into your directory. Rename .env-example to .env and enter the path to where you installed the vulkan sdk.

Build the project using make, and run. The project should compile successfully but when run produce an assertation failure that pipeline layout was not provided in config info. This will be fixed in tutorial 04

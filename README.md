# Little Vulkan Engine

A video tutorial series introducing computer graphics for [VulkanÂ®](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/), the new generation graphics and compute API from Khronos.

Currently this repository is more for use as a reference and for my own use to track the progress of this series, rather than something that can be cloned and used as a starting point, at least until I make a more robust build system.

## <a name="Building"></a> Building

This repository is still in the early stages and doesn't contain everything you may need to compile and build the code on your machine. If you wish to use this as a starting point for your project my recommendation is to follow the tutorial series. Any contributions to making a more robust, multi-platform build system are appreciated :)

#### [00 - Starting Point](littleVulkanEngine/tutorial00/)

This is the staring point to the tutorial series. It is equivalent to where you'd be at if you completed the linux section of 
setting up your development environment as described by [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment) 
with just a few small changes.

#### [01 - Opening a window](littleVulkanEngine/tutorial01/)

In the very first tutorial of this series we will be creating a class to encapsulate a glfw window, and a class to run our application.
